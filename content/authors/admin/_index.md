I am a PhD Candidate in Government at Harvard University studying political behavior in American politics. In particular, I am interested in how political geography and group identity structure political behavior. My dissertation investigates the behavioral consequences of geographic partisan polarization: how living in increasingly homogenous partisan neighborhoods makes voters more politically engaged, but also more partisan.
